#Codebook
This Codebook will explain the transformations performed in creating the tidy data set using the run_analysis.R script.
The data is obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

##Variables
trainData = training data

trainLabel = training label

trainSubject = training subject

testData = test data

testLabel = test label

testSubject = test subject

features = features

activityLabel = activity labels

allLabels = combined training and test labels with descriptive activity names

allSubjects = combined training adn test subjects with descriptive activity names

allObservations = joined dataset between test and training data filtered to contain only mean and standard deviation

tidy = tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
